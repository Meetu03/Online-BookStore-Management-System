# Online-BookStore-Management-System
A full-stack web application built using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and PostgreSQL to manage books, users, and orders in an online bookstore. The system allows users to register, log in, browse and search books, add them to the cart, and place orders. Admins can add and manage books, while the database stores user and order details securely.
